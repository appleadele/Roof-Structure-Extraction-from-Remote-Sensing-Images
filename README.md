# Roof-Structure-Extraction-from-Remote-Sensing-Images
This repository contains code from my master's thesis, including line-to-polygon conversion, model training, mask generation, and MRF-based evaluation.


## Dataset Used: Vectorization-Roof-Data-Set

This project uses the **Vectorization-Roof-Data-Set**, a dataset designed for training and testing the PPGNet model on rooftop structure vectorization tasks.

- Original dataset repository: [SimonHensel/Vectorization-Roof-Data-Set](https://github.com/SimonHensel/Vectorization-Roof-Data-Set)
- Paper: "BUILDING ROOF VECTORIZATION WITH PPGNET"

Please cite the dataset using the following reference:
